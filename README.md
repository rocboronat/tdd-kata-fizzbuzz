We're going to introduce the TDD concept to the IES Joan d'Ã€ustria students. They're software engineers from 18 to 20, and they are not used to work with tests.

In order to introduce it, we're going to expose how are they testing their own software, calling the *main()* method and trying to catch the issues with their human-powered eyes. We'll share the issues this way of testing introduces, and students will (hopefully) agree with us.

Then, we're going to introduce unit testing and TDD.
